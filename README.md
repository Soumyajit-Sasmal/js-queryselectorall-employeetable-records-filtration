__Mini demo (vanilla JS) â€” Employee table name-only filtration using querySelectorAll.__
## ðŸ”— Live Demo â†’ https://soumyajit-sasmal.github.io/js-queryselectorall-employeetable-records-filtration/
## âœ¨ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Employee Table filtration using querySelectorAll.

__ðŸ—‚ A table is created to display employee records.__

__ðŸŽ¨ CSS styling is applied using element and class selectors only (no ID-based CSS).__

__ðŸ”Ž With querySelectorAll, many rows are selected at once for filtering.__

__âœ… Filtration works only by Name and Employee ID.__

__ðŸŽ¯ When a record matches (for example: ID = 102, Name = Soumyajit Sasmal), only that row remains visible and all other rows are hidden using display: none.__

__ðŸš©This keeps the focus on how querySelectorAll can handle multiple elements efficiently for simple search tasks.__
