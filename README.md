__Mini demo (vanilla JS) — Employee table name-only filtration using querySelectorAll.__
## ✨ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Employee Table filtration using querySelectorAll.

__🗂 A table is created to display employee records.__

__🎨 CSS styling is applied using element and class selectors only (no ID-based CSS).__

__🔎 With querySelectorAll, many rows are selected at once for filtering.__

__✅ Filtration works only by Name and Employee ID.__

__🎯 When a record matches (for example: ID = 102, Name = Soumyajit Sasmal), only that row remains visible and all other rows are hidden using display: none.__

__🚩This keeps the focus on how querySelectorAll can handle multiple elements efficiently for simple search tasks.__
